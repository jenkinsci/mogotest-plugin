  Before you can trigger a test run through Jenkins you must first configure a test plan, either through
  the Mogotest web site or through our API.  If you use the API, the test plan ID is the normal one as outlined
  in the <a href="http://docs.mogotest.com/">API docs</a>.  If you configure through the web site, the test
  plan ID is part of the URL.  E.g., in the URL <i>https://mogotest.com/sites/www-quirksmode-org/groups/s5qtxk/tests/latest</i>,
  the test plan ID is <b>s5qtxk</b>.
